- Main is contained in "ContainsMain.java".  

- The program takes a single command line argument: the name of a file specifying a graph; the comments in "Graph.java" specify the correct format for this file.  Example input files are provided by "test0.txt", "test1.txt", and "test2.txt".

- Little or no error checking is performed by the program.

- The program is still provisional in that it has not fully been tested and changes might still be made in the future.

- Thank you to Yixin Cao of the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Texas A & M University for alerting me to a bug.
